# HTML2
Done my second project using pure HTML. I have created a basic table. HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns. 
A table in HTML consists of table cells inside rows and columns.

Table Cells:

Each table cell is defined by a <td> and a </td> tag.
td stands for table data.
Everything between <td> and </td> is the content of a table cell.

Table Rows:

Each table row starts with a <tr> and ends with a </tr> tag.
tr stands for table row.

Table Headers:

Sometimes you want your cells to be table header cells. In those cases use the <th> tag instead of the <td> tag:
th stands for table header.
